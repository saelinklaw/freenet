[on GitHub](https://github.com/freenet/).

The Wiki contains a list of 
[freenet-related projects](https://wiki.freenetproject.org/Projects) 
and documentation of the 
[Freenet Client Protocol](https://wiki.freenetproject.org/FCPv2)
for using Freenet from external programs.

We're happy to accept pull requests on GitHub as well as patches sent under a
pseudonym through Freenet forums such as [FMS](http://freesocial.draketo.de/fms_en.html).
