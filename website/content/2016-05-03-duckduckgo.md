The Freenet Project is very excited to announce that [DuckDuckGo have donated][ddg_url] $25,000 to our project.
This new funding will be used to advance our goal of ensuring true freedom of communication on the Internet.

The project has always operated in a democratic manner, and we will use an open process to set priorities for how we allocate this funding, which will incorporate the views of Freenetâ€™s users, developers, and supporters.
